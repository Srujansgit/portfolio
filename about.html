      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a Computer Science Engineering student at Manipal Institute of Technology specializing in Cybersecurity with a minor in Computational Intelligence. As a DevOps Engineer with experience at Intel and CazeLabs, I thrive at the intersection of automation, security, and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>My journey combines hands-on experience in containerization, CI/CD pipeline optimization, and cloud infrastructure with a deep interest in securing digital systems. I've reduced deployment times by 90% through GitHub Actions pipelines, orchestrated multi-container RAG-based AI applications, and built machine learning systems achieving 96.78% accuracy in blockchain security.</p>
      <p>Beyond technical skills, I'm an active leader in my university community, serving as an Executive Member of Null-OWASP, Executive Head of IEEE-GRSS, and holding leadership positions in multiple campus organizations. My commitment to social impact extends through my work with Samridhdhi Trust, where I helped over 500 underprivileged children develop essential skills.</p>
      <p>I bring a unique blend of technical expertise in DevOps practices, cybersecurity principles, and AI applications, coupled with strong communication and leadership skills developed through my editorial work and athletic achievements. My goal is to leverage technology to build secure, efficient, and innovative solutions that make a meaningful difference.</p>
